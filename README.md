PinballsAndFractals
===================

 A ball bounces around in a pinball machine. This is a typical situation in which a small differencein initial conditions makes a vast difference as a system evolves. This project will animate the bouncing ball and look at how minor variations in initial conditions cause instability and fractal behaviour in the dynamics, and also how varying the accuracy of floating point representation affects the apparent behaviour of the solution.



THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR PROJECT FOR UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER
