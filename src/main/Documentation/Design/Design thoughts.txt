Ideas on how to perform collision detection:
everything has the info about its own relative position
everything is stored on a map
use a single class to resolve collisions(necessary? could be done in pinball class)
everything modelled as a bounce?
threshold for just gliding along the wall?
limit max speed?
raycasting?
frame by frame? (slower but allows for more dynamic)
will be using gravity?
friction?

possible classes:

Main(initialises and sends results to a file to be processed in matlab)
endZone(zone in which when the ball arrives, the simulation ends)
pinball(holds all methods related to the ball)
bumper(holds all methods related to a bumper object)
Collision map(holds every possible collision point which is static on the game board)
stage(the actual game board)
Plunger(something which increases the ball velocity initially)
Constants(anything constant which is used in multiple classes)
Wall(blocks the path of the ball, collision on sides)
flipper(ball bounces off relative to its position on the flipper)
trigger(causes a wall to appear when collsiion event happens)
Vector(a 2d vector with associated methods)

need generics for objects?
